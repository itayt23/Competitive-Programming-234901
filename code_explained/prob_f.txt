The requirements given in the problem was:
-Every group of bandits of size at least "m" should be able to open all the locks.
-No smaller group of bandits should be able to open all the locks.

To solve those two requirements I calculated n choose (m-1) using the nChoosek function.
This way I have determine the number of distinct groups that can open the locks while satisfying both requirements.

To satisfy the first requirement:
By choosing "m-1" bandits to receive the keys for each lock, we guarantee that any group of bandits with a size of at least "m"
will have at least one bandit who possesses a key to each lock.
This is because selecting "m-1" bandits leaves room for at least one additional bandit in any group of size "m" to have access to the missing keys.

To satisfy the second requirement:
no smaller group of bandits should be able to open all the locks.
By choosing "m-1" bandits, we make sure that any group smaller than "m" will not have access to all the keys.
This is becuase they will be missing at least one key.
