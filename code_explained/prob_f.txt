the requirements given in the problem statement:

Every group of bandits of size at least "m" should be able to open all the locks.
No smaller group of bandits should be able to open all the locks.
Now, let's break down the reasoning behind using "n choose (m-1)" as the solution:

The number of locks needed corresponds to the number of distinct groups of bandits that can open the locks. Each lock represents a group, and the keys are distributed among the bandits.

To satisfy the first requirement, every group of bandits of size at least "m" should be able to open all the locks. By choosing "m-1" bandits from the total "n" bandits, we ensure that any group of size "m" will contain at least one bandit who has a key to each lock. This is because selecting "m-1" bandits leaves room for at least one additional bandit in any group of size "m" to have access to the missing key(s).

To satisfy the second requirement, no smaller group of bandits should be able to open all the locks. By choosing "m-1" bandits, we make sure that any group smaller than "m" will not have access to all the keys. This is because a smaller group cannot have all the bandits required to possess the keys to each lock.

By calculating "n choose (m-1)" using the nChoosek function, you determine the number of distinct groups that can open the locks while satisfying both requirements. This value represents the minimum number of locks needed.


By choosing "m-1" bandits to receive the keys for each lock, we guarantee that any group of bandits with a size of at least "m" will have at least one bandit who possesses a key 
to each lock. This is because any group of size "m" will include at least one bandit who was not assigned a key for a particular lock. Therefore, that bandit will not be able to open 
the lock, ensuring that the lock remains secure unless a group with at least "m" members is formed.

On the other hand, any group with a size less than "m" will not have enough bandits to cover all the locks since they will be missing at least one key. 
Thus, they will not be able to open all the locks.
