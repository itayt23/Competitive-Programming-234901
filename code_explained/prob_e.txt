The most efficient way i have found to solve this roblem without getting Run Time Error is with ternary_search.
I used Ternary_search to find the minimum value of t that results in the minimum distance covering all vehicles. 
I set 200 iterates to ensure sufficient precision in finding the minimum distance, increasing the likelihood of finding a more accurate value
for the minimum distance that covers all vehicles.
Eventually I called max_min_func(A, left) for calculates the distance covered by the vehicles at the specific time left,
which represents the minimum distance they get closest to each other and got the output.

Time complexity:
The time complexity for initializing A is O(n).
Ternary_search: O(n + TERNARY_SEARCH_PERCISION)
Overall:  O(n)
