The code implements Dijkstra's algorithm, a graph traversal algorithm, to find the shortest paths from a given source vertex to all other vertices
in a weighted graph.
The algorithm determines the shortest distances and counts of shortest paths for each vertex. 
Finally, it outputs the count of shortest paths from the source to the destination vertex.
