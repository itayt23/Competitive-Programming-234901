The compare_weights function is defined to compare two pairs containing the weight and the number of cuts for each vegetable. 
It calculates the ratio of weight to the number of cuts for each pair and returns true 
if the ratio of the first pair is smaller than the ratio of the second pair.

By using the max_element and min_element functions with the compare_weights comparison function, you can find the vegetable with the maximum ratio
and the vegetable with the minimum ratio (min_it) in the pieces vector. 
These iterators allow you to access the specific elements and their associated weights and cut counts.

Then Once you have obtained max_it and min_it, you use them to calculate the current ratios (max_val and min_val) 
by dividing the weight of each vegetable by its corresponding number of cuts.
