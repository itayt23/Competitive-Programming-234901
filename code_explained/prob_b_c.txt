In the begining i tried to solve this problem by just one min_heap, but i encountered time limit exceed problem.
Hence i understand that i have to use 2 priority_queues.
min_heap and max_heap
In the min_heap im inserting always the ADD operation, the use of the max_heap is to throw there all the i-th MINIMUM number transaction we already added to the min heap
that way, im always taking care that the head of the min_heap will contain the minimun i-th transiction.   

Time complexity:
-Every operation using min\max_heap is: O(log(u))

Since the outer while loop runs k times, the time complexity of the entire code can be approximated as follows:
Time complexity of: O((m + n * (u + log(u)))).
