In this code, I begin by gathering all the input to determine what the question mark represents: an angle or a distance.
Throughout the program, I utilize a function called "apply_instructions" that executes all the commands in a given set of instructions,
one by one, and returns the final position of the robot.

The complexity of the "apply_instructions" function is linear in the number of commands since calculating the next position is straightforward
using polar to Cartesian coordinate conversion - O(commands_number)

I have consider the robot starts and finishes its patrol at the same spot as the origin (0,0).
Additionally, the robot initially faces the positive x-axis direction, which I represent as angle 0.

Now there is 2 possible missing arg: distance or angle.
To determine a missing distance:
I leverage the fact that the sum of all the movement vectors should be zero, given that the robot ends up at the same spot.
Therefore, I assume the missing distance as 0 and observe the final position of the robot.
The missing distance corresponds to the distance between this point and the origin.
To calculate this distance, I take the absolute value of the result obtained from the "apply_instructions" function.
In this scenario, the complexity is bounded by the number of steps, which is at most n.

To determine a missing angle:
I iterate over all possible integer angles (0-359).
I replace the question mark with the appropriate angle in the instructions and use the "apply_instructions" function to obtain the final position.
If the robot ends up at the origin, I output the current angle as the correct answer.
In this case, the complexity is bounded by 360 multiplied by the number of steps, which can be up to 360 * commands.

Overall, considering that the maximum number of commands is 1000, the entire process can have a maximum of 360,000 steps, which is relatively low.
