The line for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) m = m * 10; is used to compute the modulus m based on the value of x.
I set m to the value of 10^x. Using this modulus m, the code ensures that the decrypted numbers have at most x digits.
so the result is taken modulo m to keep only the last x digits.

after that, for every encrypted number i save it in modulo m to Maintain the cyclic nature of the encryption.
The encryption process described in the problem statement involves adding the left and right neighbors of each number. 
Since the encryption is cyclic (the first and last numbers are considered neighbors), it is essential to ensure that the numbers remain consistent within the cyclic structure. 
Applying the modulus operation ensures that the numbers wrap around within the range of m and preserve the cyclic property during decryption.


The line circulant_matrix[0] = 1 assigns the coefficient for the number itself, which means that each number in the encrypted message is multiplied by 1. 
This step is necessary because each number contributes to the decrypted value by itself.

The line circulant_matrix[1] = l assigns the coefficient for the left neighbor. This means that each number is multiplied by l times its left neighbor in the decrypted message. 
The value of l determines the weight or significance given to the left neighbor in the decryption process.

The line circulant_matrix[n - 1] = r assigns the coefficient for the right neighbor. This means that each number is multiplied by r times its right neighbor in the decrypted message. 
Similarly, the value of r determines the weight or significance given to the right neighbor in the decryption process.

explain of the operation:

while (s_times) {
        if (s_times % 2 == 1) mul_circulant(circulant_matrix, enc, n, m);
        mul_circulant(circulant_matrix, circulant_matrix, n, m);
        s_times /= 2;
    }

In the given problem, the decryption procedure involves applying a linear transformation to the encrypted message using the circulant matrix. The circulant matrix represents the rules for decrypting the message, where each row of the matrix determines the coefficients to multiply the neighboring numbers.

To decrypt the message for s_times iterations, you need to repeatedly apply this linear transformation. Instead of performing the transformation s_times times individually, you can use matrix exponentiation to achieve the same result more efficiently.

Updating the circulant_matrix to its squared value using mul_circulant(circulant_matrix, circulant_matrix, n, m) effectively applies the linear transformation twice, as if you were performing the transformation twice in a row. This operation helps you calculate the transformation for s_times iterations more efficiently by reducing the number of individual transformations needed.

By repeatedly squaring the circulant_matrix in each iteration of the while loop, you gradually build up the transformation for s_times iterations. This approach significantly reduces the computational complexity compared to directly performing the transformation s_times times, especially for larger values of s_times.
