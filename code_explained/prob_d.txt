I stared by consider different scenarios based on the value of the target score and constructs the required shots accordingly.
Im starting with checking the simple solution for the target score.
If-else statment for target score until:
-20
-40
-60
-80
-100
-120
-140
-160

If the target score is above 160 than, i check with a while loop all the possible option in a way that im always trying to take as many triple shot, then double and lastly single shots. 
If a valid combination of shots is not possible to reach the target score, im outputs "impossible".
