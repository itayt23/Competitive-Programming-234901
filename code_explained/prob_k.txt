As we learned in class I have tried to use the concept of the convex hull to find the minimum distance from a given set of points,
to any side of the convex polygon formed by those points.
Im iterating over all sides of the polygon, computing the maximum distance for each side, and keeps track of the minimum distance encountered.
The minimum slot size, is the largest gap between the points and any side of the polygon.
